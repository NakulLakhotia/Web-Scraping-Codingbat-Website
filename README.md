### **Problem Statement**
There are times when you want to scrape data, but all the data is not available in a single webpage of the website. You might have to keep jumping from one link to the other just to get a small portion of the data. So writing a different code and using a different URL everytime to scrape the data is not feasible and is time consuming.

### ** Scraping Code **

This code shows you how in a single code you can visit different webpages of a website, scrape the data and store them.

We scrape all the java programming questions from the [*Codingbat*](https://codingbat.com/java) Website from each sub-topic using BeautifulSoup
